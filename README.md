this is a python tool for editing YouTube downloaded music.
most of downloading apps for music in Youtube don't tag artist, this tool does that for you
it can detect the artist and tag it in the the mp3 file
it can detect the song name and tag it in the proper section
it also can rename the mp3file to the song name instead of artist name and song and bunch of other words like official ... , the tool removes all unneeded words.

feel free to suggest new options, changes , fixes.
